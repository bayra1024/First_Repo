      Why do we give flowers as gifts? <br />
      To Communicate Emotions <br />
      The biggest reason we give flowers as gifts is to connect with an emotion.
      Whether its love, joy, affection, appreciation, sympathy, romance or
      apologies; flower giving communicates the deepest feelings in the most
      elegant manner. Not only women like to receive flowers, but also men.

        <h3>Roses</h3>
        <p>
          The traditional symbol of love, romance, passion, and desire, red rose
          flowers will always be the best way to say “I Love You” to that
          special someone in your life. The gorgeous red roses also reflect the
          beauty and perfection that are used for the bridal bouquet

        <h3>Lilies</h3>
        <p>
          Lilies most commonly mean devotion or purity, though meaning can vary
          by type of lily, culture, and color. Because of the Greek myth of Hera
          and Zeus, lilies are associated with rebirth and motherhood. In China,
          lilies are used in weddings because they are tied to 100 years of
          love. They are also tied to good luck./p&gt;

        <p>
          The Egyptians believed that they symbolised a closeness to nature and
          a devotion to the sun, whereas the Celts thought they lessened the
          sorrows and stresses of everyday life. Generally, gerberas symbolise
          innocence, purity, cheerfulness and loyal love.

            In Norse mythology, the daisy is known as the sacred flower for the

              with heartfelt emotion, gratitude for understanding, and apology
              after a Japanese emperor gave them to the family of the girl he
              loved to make up for neglecting her in favor of business and show
              how much he cared about her.
